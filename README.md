# iris_dataset_analysis

This project involves some analysis of iris data set.

it includes loading the basic modules, and the dataset, then doing a bit of exploration, after that training logistic regressor, KNeighbors and decisiontree algorithmns. 

This is my first "complete" project am working on to have an intuition of how a machine learning project would be coupled up with data analysis tools.
